# Nerdy icebreaker party games

## Introduction
These games are icebreakers for parties of any size. They are especially well suited for *nerds*, in particular research groups. They were tested and approved by [NERDS](https://nerds.itu.dk).

## Nerdgame (5 min)
[üìÅ nerdgame](/nerdgame/)

A Korean survival/elimination game to find the biggest nerd. Everyone starts standing and should have their own chair available. Nerdy questions are chosen randomly and read out loud round by round. In each round, everyone who answers "No" is eliminated and has to sit down.

**Who wins?** Last nerd standing. If the "last nerd" is multiple people, choose a new question.

## Bingo

Every person gets 1 sheet with 9 questions. Walk around in the room and find 1 other person whose name you can write down as answer. Once you have answered all the 9 questions, you shout "Bingo". It is NOT allowed to: use your own name; use the same name twice or more.

The `bingo_prod.ipynb` produces a worddoc `bingosheets` with 30 pages; each page contains 9 randomly selected questions from the `bingos.csv` file.
