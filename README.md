A Korean survival/elimination game to find the biggest nerd. Everyone starts standing and should have their own chair available. Nerdy questions are chosen randomly and read out loud round by round. In each round, everyone who answers "No" is eliminated and has to sit down.

**Who wins?** Last nerd standing. If the "last nerd" is multiple people, choose a new question.
